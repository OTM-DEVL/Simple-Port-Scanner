# Simple-Port-Scanner
This program is a port scanner that is written in Java programming language.
It was a mini-project I and a classmate worked on together.
This program helps the user to scan and identify ports that are opened.
This information allows the user to close the ports to prevent malware and any form of attack on their system.
